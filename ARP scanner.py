#In summary, the ARP scan starts by sending an ARP request asking about the MAC address associated with the IP address 192.168.2.1.
#The received packet is a response, providing the requested informationâ€”mapping the IP address 192.168.2.1 to the MAC address 40:c7:29:fd:6b:88.
#This process helps in discovering live hosts on the network and their corresponding MAC addresses.

#The "/24" denotes the subnet mask, and it means that the first 24 bits of the IP address are used for the network portion, leaving the remaining 8 bits for host addresses.
#In practical terms, this means there are 2^8 (256) possible host addresses in this subnet.
